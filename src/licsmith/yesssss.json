  "What is the name/type of the license (MIT, Apache 2.0, GPLv3, BSD, proprietary, etc.)?": "1) What is the name/type of the license?  \n2) BSD 3-Clause.  \n3) The license is explicitly named as the \"BSD 3-Clause License\" in the first line of the text, which identifies it as a BSD-type license. This is directly stated in the header: \"BSD 3-Clause License\".",
  "Is it a standard open-source license or a custom license?": "1) Is it a standard open-source license or a custom license?  \n2) Yes.  \n3) The license is a well-known and widely recognized open-source license—the BSD 3-Clause License—which is considered a standard open-source license. This is evident from its structure, wording, and public use in the open-source community. The license includes standard clauses for redistribution, attribution, and disclaimer of warranties, all of which are typical of the BSD family of licenses. (See the license text: \"Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met.\")",
  "What is the copyright notice (holder(s) and year(s))?": "1) What is the copyright notice (holder(s) and year(s))?  \n2) The copyright notice is: Copyright (c) 2008-2011, AQR Capital Management, LLC, Lambda Foundry, Inc. and PyData Development Team and Copyright (c) 2011-2025, Open source contributors.  \n3) The notice lists two periods: 2008–2011 for AQR Capital Management, LLC, Lambda Foundry, Inc., and the PyData Development Team, and 2011–2025 for Open source contributors. This is explicitly stated in the first line of the license.",
  "Does the license allow commercial use?": "1) Does the license allow commercial use?  \n2) Yes.  \n3) The BSD 3-Clause License permits redistribution and use in source and binary forms, including for commercial purposes, as long as the copyright notice and disclaimer are included. This is explicitly stated in the license conditions, which allow use \"with or without modification\" and do not restrict commercial use.",
  "Does it allow private use?": "1) Does it allow private use?  \n2) Yes.  \n3) The license permits redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, as long as the copyright notice and conditions are retained. Private use falls under \"use\" and is not restricted by the license, as long as the required attribution is maintained. This is covered under the first condition of the license.",
  "Can the code be modified?": "1) Can the code be modified?  \n2) Yes.  \n3) Yes, the code can be modified because the license allows redistribution in source and binary forms with or without modification, as long as the copyright notice and license conditions are retained (Section 1).",
  "Can modified versions be distributed?": "1) Can modified versions be distributed?  \n2) Yes.  \n3) Yes, modified versions can be distributed as long as the original copyright notice, list of conditions, and disclaimer are included in both source and binary forms, as required by Section 1 of the BSD 3-Clause License.",
  "Is sublicensing permitted (can I re-license my modifications)?": "1) Is sublicensing permitted (can I re-license my modifications)?  \n2) Not found.  \n3) The BSD 3-Clause License does not explicitly address sublicensing or the re-licensing of modifications. While it allows redistribution with attribution, it does not grant or restrict the right to re-license derivative works. The absence of a specific clause on sublicensing means this information is not directly provided in the license text.",
  "Is attribution required (do I need to credit the author)?": "1) Is attribution required (do I need to credit the author)?  \n2) Yes.  \n3) Attribution is required when redistributing source code or binary forms; specifically, the copyright notice, list of conditions, and disclaimer must be included (as stated in Section 1 of the license). While the license does not explicitly require \"crediting the author\" in a personal or public way, it mandates retaining the copyright notice, which includes the names of the copyright holders (e.g., AQR Capital Management, Lambda Foundry, PyData Development Team, and Open source contributors). This constitutes a form of attribution.",
  "Must I include a copy of the license in redistributions?": "1) Must I include a copy of the license in redistributions?  \n2) Yes.  \n3) Yes, because the license requires that redistributions (in source or binary form) must include the copyright notice, the list of conditions, and the disclaimer—this includes a copy of the license itself. This is explicitly stated in Section 1: \"Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\"",
  "Are there copyleft obligations (must derivative works use the same license)?": "1) Are there copyleft obligations (must derivative works use the same license)?  \n2) No.  \n3) The BSD 3-Clause License does not impose copyleft obligations. It allows redistribution with minimal conditions (retaining copyright notices and disclaimer), but does not require derivative works to use the same license or distribute under the same terms. This is consistent with the permissive nature of the BSD license, as noted in the license text which explicitly does not require derivative works to be open-sourced or licensed under the same terms.",
  "Are there requirements to disclose source code of modifications?": "1) Are there requirements to disclose source code of modifications?  \n2) Yes.  \n3) Yes, source code modifications must retain the above copyright notice, list of conditions, and disclaimer when redistributed in source form. This is required under Section 1 of the BSD 3-Clause License, which states that \"Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\"",
  "Does it impose notice requirements (e.g., stating changes made)?": "1) Does it impose notice requirements (e.g., stating changes made)?  \n2) Yes.  \n3) The license requires that redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this list of conditions, and the following disclaimer. While it does not explicitly require stating changes made, the requirement to retain the full copyright notice and conditions implies a notice obligation. This is covered under the first condition: \"Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\" However, no specific requirement to disclose modifications is stated. Thus, while notice is required, explicit disclosure of changes is not mandated.",
  "Does the license disclaim warranty?": "1) Does the license disclaim warranty?  \n2) Yes.  \n3) The license explicitly states: \"THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS 'AS IS' AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.\" This is found in the final section of the license.",

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES...\" (Section 4).",
  "Are there patent clauses (grant, termination, or restrictions)?": "1) Are there patent clauses (grant, termination, or restrictions)?  \n2) Not found.  \n3) The BSD 3-Clause License does not contain any provisions related to patents, such as patent grants, patent termination, or patent restrictions. The license focuses on copyright and disclaimer of warranties, with no mention of patent rights or obligations.",
  "Are there restrictions on field of use (e.g., non-commercial only)?": "1) Are there restrictions on field of use (e.g., non-commercial only)?  \n2) No.  \n3) The BSD 3-Clause License allows redistribution and use in source and binary forms for any purpose, including commercial use, as long as the copyright notice and disclaimer are included.

  "Are there jurisdiction or governing law clauses?": "1) Are there jurisdiction or governing law clauses?  \n2) Not found.  \n3) The LICENSE does not contain any mention of jurisdiction, governing law, or legal jurisdiction clauses. The text focuses on copyright, redistribution, and liability disclaimers, but no specific legal jurisdiction or governing law is specified.",
  "Does the license include additional permissions beyond the standard template?": "1) Does the license include additional permissions beyond the standard template?  \n2) No.  \n3) The BSD 3-Clause License includes only the standard permissions for redistribution with attribution and no additional rights or permissions beyond those specified in the standard template. The license explicitly limits use to redistribution with proper notice and prohibits endorsement without prior written permission, which aligns with the typical structure of a BSD-style license. No additional permissions are granted beyond the three conditions and the disclaimer of warranties.",
  "Does it include additional restrictions (more restrictive than normal)?": "1) Does it include additional restrictions (more restrictive than normal)?  \n2) No.  \n3) The BSD 3-Clause License is permissive and does not impose additional restrictions beyond the standard requirements: retaining copyright notices, attributing contributors, and prohibiting use of names to endorse products without permission. It does not restrict commercial use, modification, or distribution beyond these minimal conditions. No more restrictive clauses are present.",
  "Is there dual licensing (can I choose between two licenses)?": "Q: Is there dual licensing (can I choose between two licenses)?  \nA: No.  \nExplanation: The license is a single BSD 3-Clause License and does not mention or provide for dual licensing or the option to choose between two different licenses.",
  "Does the project have a CLA (Contributor License Agreement) that affects usage?": "Q: Does the project have a CLA (Contributor License Agreement) that affects usage?\n\nA: Not found.\n\nExplanation: The provided BSD 3-Clause License does not mention or reference a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). The license outlines conditions for redistribution and use but does not specify any requirement for contributors to sign a CLA, nor does it affect end-user usage in that regard.",
  "Can I use this package in proprietary/commercial software?": "1) Can I use this package in proprietary/commercial software?  \n2) Yes.  \n3) The BSD 3-Clause License allows redistribution and use in source and binary forms, including for commercial or proprietary software, as long as the copyright notice, list of conditions, and disclaimer are included. This is explicitly stated in the license conditions.",
  "Do I need to make my own code open-source if I use this package?": "1) Do I need to make my own code open-source if I use this package?  \n2) No.  \n3) The BSD 3-Clause License only requires that you retain the original copyright notice and license terms when redistributing the software. It does not require you to make your own code open-source or share your modifications. This is a permissive license that allows private or proprietary use of the software without obligations to open-source your own work. (Section: \"Redistribution and use... are permitted provided that the following conditions are met\")",
  "What attribution text or notices must I include in my app or docs?": "1) What attribution text or notices must I include in my app or docs?  \n2) The full copyright notice and the three conditions must be included.  \n3) You must retain the original copyright notice, this list of conditions, and the disclaimer in both source and binary forms (Section 1).
